            <li>
                1. There’s really only one minion

Believe it or not, Despicable Me and Minions co-director Pierre Coffin voices all of the minions himself. For the new film, Coffin voiced 899 of the little yellow henchmen.
            </li>
            <li>2. Yes, you’ve seen them somewhere before

                The minions’ design was inspired by the Jawas from Star Wars and the Oompa Loompas from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. At first there were talks of the minions being tall and orc-like. Thankfully that didn’t happen!
            </li>
            <li>3. Technically, they’re multilingual

                The minions’ cute jumbled language “Minionese” is actually a mix of Spanish, English, French and Italian with additional elements of Russian and Korean. And they seem to understand English pretty well, too. They’re worldly little guys.
            </li>
            <li>4. They’re older than they look

                Coffin explained that the minions developed their eclectic language based on the fact that they’re an ancient and prehistoric race that have served various masters from around the world for centuries.
            </li>
            <li>5. It’s kind of a boys’ club, as all of the minions are male.
            </li>
            <li>
            6. Purple equals bad, yellow equals good
        </li>
            <li>7. Being a minion is a little bit like living in North Korea
            </li>
            <li>8. The tall minions share a barber
            </li>
            <li>9. Their real origin story has nothing to do with Minions
            </li>
            <li>10. No one knows how minions reproduce
            </li>
            <li>11. Everyone loves them</li>
        </ul>

            <li>
                2.The entire attack scene on Port Royal was shot in a single take.
            </li>

            <li>3.Although the cursed pirates cannot be killed, they can be hurt.
            </li>

            <li>4.The parrot was used as a device to insert verbal references to the Disneyland ride.</li>

            <li>5.The oars and sails on The Black Pearl pay homage to a ship belonging to Captain William Kidd.</li>

            <li>6.The filmmakers made sure to include multiple nods to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland in the film, including this jail scene.</li>

            <li>
                7.Johnny Depp actually wrote one of the final lines of the film.
